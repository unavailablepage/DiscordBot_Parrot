<h1>Parrot</h1>

<p>This is a Discord text-to-speech bot.</p>

<p>It is currently being run on Repl.it.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Many users use Discord's voice channels to communicate with their friends. Some users are unable to use their mics, forcing them to use a text channel.</p>

<p>The other users in the call may not check the text channel often enough. In an effort to be more inclusive for users unable to use their mic, Parrot can be used to read the users' messages aloud.</p>
